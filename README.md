Kanari allows you to record your event, and while recording it, you can collect realtime user feedback of what they enjoy about the event. For example, you can put on the beta of your theatre play and during the performance people can 'thumb-up' or 'thumb-down' during the event. At the end of the event, you can see analytics of which parts people enjoy, hate or are confused about.
